1. Idea of design

1.1 Overal design for health monitoring
Each node p in the system generates and publishes its own health report to a topic "p_health" at a constant rate m. 
Now the rate is fixed at 1 (i.e publishing health report every 1 second, which is much slower than the execution 
rate of the node itself. The health report of each node only includes flags info about the messages that the node receives 
during the 1 second period.
There is a node called "monitor"(newly added to the original system) which subscribes to all those "*_health" topic.
In the step function of the "monitor", it checks the flags of the incoming health reports. If a health report times out,
then that implies the corresponding node has died. It also checks the content of the health reports.   

1.2 "Monitor" keyword extension
A new keyword "Monitor" is added to the publication structure. It is used to indicate whether a publication is monitor-related
(i.e publish health report). The publication of health report is different from the publication of other messages for 
the following reasons:
1) User should not alter the content of health report through the *out* param of the step function.
2) Health report is published at a different rate from the rate of each node.

If you want to specifiy a monitor-related publication, you should add "Monitor" field to the publication and set it to true.
The publication where "Monitor" is omitted or is set to false will be regarded as a normal publication.

1.3 Transformation of RADL spec
In order to achieve health monitoring, you should modify the original RADL spec. Here are the steps:
1) For each node p, in the "PUBLISHES", add a new publication which publishes messages to "p_health" topic.
2) Define "p_health" topic in RADL.
3) Define a new node "monitor" which subscribes to all the "*_health" topics.
4) Definde step function for node "monitor".

Please refer to examples/monitor/health_monitor/ori_health_monitor.radl and examples/monitor/health_monitor/health_monitor.radl


2. Plan
2.1 Automatic RADL to RADL transformation
Automatically transform ori_health_monitor.radl to health_monitor.radl and generate monitor step function.
